Hello Everyone!

This is my project that makes use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is a semi-travel guide revolving around tech in Singapore. The website includes 6 pages, and the content varies from Tech exhibitions to Tech Stores.
Hopefully, you can view and enjoy looking through the website!
